User Story

As a shopaholic I want to be able to monitor my spending so that 
I can keep myself accountable and track what I am spending on.

When I add all my expenses to the program => it gives me a breakdown 
of my top spending categories.

I can also keep track of my cash flow by adding in income and credits.
